# Development methods

## Waterfall model

Not very flexible. It flows in one direction, downwards like a waterfall. 
The main concept here is that you split development into phases, and once a phase is done, you move on to the next phase.

In Royce's original waterfall model, the following phases are followed in order:
1. System and software requrements: captured in a product requirements document.
2. Analysis: resulting in models, schema and business rules.
3. Design: resulting in the software architecture.
4. Coding: the development, proving and integration of software.
5. Testing: the systematic discovery and debugging of defects.
6. Operations: the installation, migration, support and maintenance of complete systems.

### Supporting arguments

Time spent early in the software production cycle can reduce costs at later stages. For example, a problem found in the early stages (such as requirements specification) is cheaper to fix than the same bug found later on in the process (by a factor of 50 to 200).

It puts emphasis on documentation and models, as these to a large degree need to be present before coding starts.

The approach is also very structured and easy to wrap your head around. The teams focus is very clear as each phase has a distinct focus. 

It might also the more clear to the customer how far the product has come in to production by looking at which phase the development team is currently working in.

It is argued that the waterfall model can be suited to projects where requirements and scope are fixed, the product itself is firm and stable, and the technology is clearly understood.

### Criticism

The biggest flaw of the waterfall method is the fact that most customers usually don't really know what they want. The have a general idea, but that might quickly change as development moves forward. The waterfall method is very poor at adapting to such changing requirements.
