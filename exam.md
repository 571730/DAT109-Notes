# Development methods

## Waterfall model

Not very flexible. It flows in one direction, downwards like a waterfall. 
The main concept here is that you split development into phases, and once a phase is done, you move on to the next phase.

In Royce's original waterfall model, the following phases are followed in order:
1. System and software requrements: captured in a product requirements document.
2. Analysis: resulting in models, schema and business rules.
3. Design: resulting in the software architecture.
4. Coding: the development, proving and integration of software.
5. Testing: the systematic discovery and debugging of defects.
6. Operations: the installation, migration, support and maintenance of complete systems.
